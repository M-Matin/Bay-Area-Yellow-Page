# Neighborhood-Map
This is the fifth project of  **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.**

As I live in Concord CA, I included my favorite resturant in Concord.

I designed this App to let others access with filter when they type the name of resturant. The marker on each places give you a basic info of that specific place.

All the info of the places is coming from third party website (in my case Foursquare.)

This app is designed responsive for any size of device. You can try it by changing the size of your device.
